# Build a Photo Gallery

In this lab, you'll be taking some raw HTML with images and turning it in to a beautiful photo gallery!

We've included some photos already, but feel free to replace these with your own.

Fork and clone this repository to begin with a starter template. You'll need to use your CSS grid ninja skills to make it responsive and beautiful.
